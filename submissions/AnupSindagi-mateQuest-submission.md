## Project Description    
_What have you built during the hackathon?_

mateQuest is a platform where you can practice chess mating lines. In chess, during the endgame, there are positions on the board where you can achieve a 
forced checkmate, where no matter what move your opponent plays, you can checkmate them. mateQuest is a platform built to help users practice these positions, to analyze mating positions, 
and deliver checkmates without losing advantage.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
_What is the story behind this project? Why did you choose to work on this specific idea?_

I have always struggled finding mating lines in chess, even when I'm at an advantage. There are many games where I have lost the advantage and lost the game on time because 
I could not find the mating line. My motivation was to build a platform where one could master endgame mating lines.
